I'm using Globe Tattoo Home DSL and I've had to deal with this problem for a number of days and tried different solutions to no avail, until an officemate of mine suggested that it might be a DNS peering problem between Globe and Google. He then told me to set my primary and secondary DNS to 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.1 respectively and voila!<br /><br />As another officemate once said about Internet connectivity issues: it's always a DNS problem.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9158185691727614820-7152764786642012700?l=www.relaxdiego.com' alt='' /></div>
