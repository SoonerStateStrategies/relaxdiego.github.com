I spent my morning today introducing the magic of programming to a
class of 2nd graders and it was amazing. It was also one of my more
nervewracking experiences as far as preperations went. I was so nervous
I spent the better portion of my morning (starting at 6AM!) researching
and preparing my material.

Having the [Creative Computing](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/)
site was a huge thing because it pretty much wrote all the material
that I needed to get the kids excited. For a 45-minute session though,
I only had time to get them excited about Scratch and to try out a few
very simple exercises. Basically, I boiled down the session to the
following activities:

I later found out that she was one of the most shy kids in the class.

the class!

They were so enthusiastic and so full of energy I could barely keep up!
Thank god Mrs. Johnston, their class teacher, was there to help keep things
under control. I was still so nervous but somehow I got their attention
all throughout. We finished early with about 15 minutes to spare so we
had them take out their workstations and try out Scratch themselves.

Boy did they try it out! It was amazing to see their eyes light up with
every new thing they discovered with Scratch and programming in general.
To them though, they weren't programming. They were playfully creating
and that's how programming should be whether your 8 or 80 years old!

But the best part about this experience was when it was time for them to
have their recess. Before going out, every single one of them approached
me to say how much they enjoyed it ("Mr. Mark this is the bestest thing
ever!!!") while some didn't say anything, they just went ahead gave me hugs.

It's hard not to fall in love with these kids. They will forever have a
special place in my heart.
