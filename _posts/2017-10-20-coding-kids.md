Today, I spent my morning introducing the magic of programming to a
class of 2nd graders and it was amazing. It was also one of the more
nerve-racking experiences as far as preperations go. I was so nervous
I spent the better portion of my morning (starting at 6AM) researching
and preparing!

Having the [Creative Computing](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/)
site was a huge thing because it pretty much wrote all the material
that I needed and more! For a 45-minute session though, I only had
time to get them excited about Scratch and to try out a few very simple
exercises. Basically, I boiled down the session to the following activities:

I later found out that she was one of the more shy kids
<br/>in the class. Yet she voluntarily raised her hand to
<br/>try out Scratch in front of the class!

Of course my boy HAD to show off his Scratch fu!

They were so enthusiastic and so full of energy I could barely keep up!
Thank god their teacher, Mrs. Johnston, was there to help keep things
under control. I was nervous for the most part but somehow got their
undivided attention throughout the session. We finished early with about
15 minutes to spare so we had them take out their workstations and try
out Scratch themselves.

Boy did they try it out! It was amazing to see their eyes light up with
every new thing they discovered with Scratch and programming in general.
I bet though that, to them, they weren't programming. They were playfully
creating and experimenting which is, I believe, how programming should be
whether you're 8 or 80 years old!

The best part about this experience, however, was when it was time for
them to have their recess. Before going out to play, every single one of
them approached me to say how much they enjoyed it ("Mr. Mark this is
the best best best thing ever!!!") while some didn't say anything, they
just quietly gave me the sweetest of hugs.

It's hard not to fall in love with these kids. They've now cemented a
special place in my heart and I can't wait to see the amazing things that
they'll create with Scratch.
