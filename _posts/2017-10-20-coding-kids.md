I spent my morning today introducing the magic of programming to a
class of 2nd graders and it was amazing. It was also one of my more
nervewracking experiences as far as preperations went. I was so nervous
I spent the better portion of my morning (starting at 6AM!) researching
and preparing!

Having the [Creative Computing](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/)
site was a huge thing because it pretty much wrote all the material
that I needed and more! For a 45-minute session though, I only had
time to get them excited about Scratch and to try out a few very simple
exercises. Basically, I boiled down the session to the following activities:

I later found out that she was one of the more shy kids
<br/>in the class. Yet she voluntarily raised her hand to
<br/>try out Scratch in front of the class!

Of course my boy HAD to show off his Scratch fu!

They were so enthusiastic and so full of energy I could barely keep up!
Thank god Mrs. Johnston, their class teacher, was there to help keep things
under control. I was still so nervous but somehow I got their attention
all throughout. We finished early with about 15 minutes to spare so we
had them take out their workstations and try out Scratch themselves.

Boy did they try it out! It was amazing to see their eyes light up with
every new thing they discovered with Scratch and programming in general.
To them though, they weren't programming. They were playfully creating
and experimenting and I believe that's how programming should be whether
your 8 or 80 years old!

But the best part about this experience was when it was time for them to
have their recess. Before going out, every single one of them approached
me to say how much they enjoyed it ("Mr. Mark this is the bestest thing
ever!!!") while some didn't say anything, they just gave me the sweetest
of hugs.

It's hard not to fall in love with these kids. They will forever have a
special place in my heart.
