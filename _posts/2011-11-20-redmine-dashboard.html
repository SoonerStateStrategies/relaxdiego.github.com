A little something I wrote while I was on a plane from Manila to LA a few months back. This is actually the earliest prototype of the mini-project I was talking about earlier. I used <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">backbone.js</a> and I really feel that it helped me speed up development. It took a little time to get my head wrapped around the collection concept but once I understood that, everything else made a lot of sense. Here's a screenshot of how it looks like once you get it working:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5mW3KUVw2KM/Ttb0VRo5PQI/AAAAAAAAE24/5v4mTYwdZME/s1600/Screen+Shot+2011-12-01+at+11.21.40+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="260" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5mW3KUVw2KM/Ttb0VRo5PQI/AAAAAAAAE24/5v4mTYwdZME/s320/Screen+Shot+2011-12-01+at+11.21.40+AM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />You can grab the code <a href="https://github.com/relaxdiego/redmine_dashboard">here</a>. Please note that it's purely in conceptual stage right now and I really only wrote this to help me understand one part of the real project I had in mind.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9158185691727614820-8727868045943831963?l=www.relaxdiego.com' alt='' /></div>
