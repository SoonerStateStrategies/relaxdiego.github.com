I like elegant solutions because they are easier to administer. In fact, I believe that a solution is truly elegant if you do not even need to actively administer it. One thing to note about elegance though is that it's hard to achieve if you're harried, if you're out of time, trying to deal with too many things at time, etc. So it's important to be aware of you current state of mind and be sure that you are focused. Otherwise, you'll never achieve that elegant solution you have in mind.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9158185691727614820-121477916239977779?l=www.relaxdiego.com' alt='' /></div>
