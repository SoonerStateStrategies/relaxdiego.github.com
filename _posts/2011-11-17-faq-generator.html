Here's a quick and dirty ruby script I made to extract issues from a project in Redmine and output it to an HTML file. I originally wrote this to compile issues in a project named 'FAQs' where we internally discuss FAQs and their answers before publishing to the wild. Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/relaxdiego/FAQs">Github</a>.<br /><br />After looking at that code, you might ask why I used pandoc instead of plain old erb or some other Ruby-based templating gem.

Needless to say, my fingers are itching to clean up this code.
