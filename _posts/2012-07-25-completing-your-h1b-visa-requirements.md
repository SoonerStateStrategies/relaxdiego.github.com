I've just completed the last requirement before I can leave for the USA using my H1B Visa. Specifically, I've received my Overseas Employment Certificate (OEC) from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). It wasn't as bad as I expected, but that's probably because I expected for the worst given my past experiences with Philippine government agencies. The whole ordeal took 1.5 days to complete including securing my medical certificate.

If you're a direct hire (also referred to as 'Name Hire' by POEA) H1B US Visa holder, I hope the following information helps you. Please note that I'm narrating the steps based on my experience from the PEOA head office at EDSA corner Ortigas Avenue. The exact steps might be different when in the regional offices but should be mostly similar.

## Backgrounder

* You must secure your OEC from POEA or you cannot leave the country even if you wave your H1B Visa in front of the government folks at the airport. :-)
* The OEC will exempt you from paying the P1,000+ travel tax and the P750 terminal fee. Make sure to bring 2 photocopies of the doc before going to the airport.

## OEC Requirements

Before heading out to the POEA office, make sure you have the following docs with you (Please note that this is based on my experience last July 2012. The requirements may have changed in the future so please check with POEA).

* Employment Contract (Original + Photocopy) - The contract must state the period of employment, salary, just causes of termination of the contract, and a clause stating that your employer will pay for the cost of sending your remains back to the Philippines should you die. If your contract doesn't have the last two items, the POEA will provide you with a form containing these information, you must send this to your employer for signing before you can continue. I've included the exact wording of the relevant parts of this form in the next section.
* I-797B Notice of Action from the US Department of Homeland Security (Original + Photocopy)
* Labor Condition Application for Nonimmigrant Workers from the US Department of Labor (Original + Photocopy)
* Medical Certificate (Original + Photocopy) - This must come from a DOH accredited medical center. I got mine from the Philippine Overseas Workers Medical and Diagnostic Center, Inc. which is located at the 9th floor of the State Center Building which is right beside the POEA head office along Ortigas Avenue. The cost was P2,380 and I got my medical certificate 1 day after my examination.
* Passport (Original + Photocopy)
* Visa (Original + Photocopy)
* Two 2x2 colored photos with white background - I was told to bring this so I did. However, it was never used by POEA. Bring yours with you anyway just to be sure.
* Long folder - Organize the above documents in this folder.
* Pre-departure Orientation Seminar Certificate (Original + Photocopy) - You can get this from the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). They conduct seminars at the POEA head office but check with OWWA if this seminar is available in other places.

## Additional Contract Requirements

The following information must be included in your contract. If not, you might be able to ask your employer to send you an additional signed document with the following information. Please note that I copied this straight from POEA's form # FM-POEA-04-EF-08D:

1. Just causes of termination of the contract;
  1. Termination by employer: The employer may terminate this Contract on the following just causes: serious misconduct, wilful disobedience of employer's lawful orders, habitual neglect of duties, absenteeism, insubordination, revealing secrets of establishment, when employee violates customs, traditions and laws of host country and/or terms of this agreement. The employee shall shoulder the repatriation expenses;
  1. Termination by employee: The employee may terminate this Contract without serving any notice to the employer for any of the following just causes: serious insult by the employer or his representative, inhuman and unbearable treatment accorded the employee by the employer or his representative, commission of crime/offense by the employer or his representative. The employer shall pay the repatriation expenses back to the Philippines.
  1. Termination due to illness: Either party may terminate the contract on the ground of illness disease or injury by employee. The employer shall shoulder the cost of repatriation.
1. In the event of death the employee during terms of this agreement, his remains and personal belongins shall be repatriated to the Philippines at the expense of the employer. In case the repatriation of remains is not possible, the same may be disposed of upon approval of the employee's next of kin and/or by the nearest Philippine Embassy or Consulate at the worksite, the employer's expense;

If the above is already part of your contract, then good. Otherwise, it might speed up your POEA processing if you ask for an attachment to your contract stating the above.

## The Process

1. At the POEA head office, head straight through the entrance, then look for the guard to the right of the elevators and ask for a number for step 1 of the direct hire process.
2. Go to the stairs found to the right of the elevators. You'll pass the mezzanine before you get to the second floor.
3. At the second floor, go left, then left again. Enter the room at the end of the hall. Take a seat and wait for your number to be called. Pay attention as they will call the numbers in batches.
4. When your number is ready, walk briskly to the appropriate counter/window so that you'll be the first in line!
5. Provide your documents (including the folder) to the officer in the window. She will go through your docs to check if they're complete. If not, she will give you a checklist indicating the missing items and you need to secure said items. If all is well, pat yourself on the back.
6. Go down the first floor to get a number for step 2. This time, get it from the guard to the left of the elevators. Then, go back to the same room you went to for step 1. This is a really strange arrangement, I know, but that seems to be how things work at the POEA.
7. Go line up at any of the step 2 windows and give your docs again to the officer. She will then give you two docs to fill up. Take a seat, fill those docs in, then give it back to the officer.
8. Once step 2 is done, go to step 3 where another officer will assess your fees.
9. Go to the cashier which should be just beside the step 3 window and pay your dues. At the time, I paid P6,600+.
10. After payment, you should now have your OEC but you need to go to the next window the cashier tells you.
11. This window is the Pag Ibig window and they will check your membership. You can optionally pay for future monthly dues. I decided to pay for the next 12 months (P1,200 at the time) just so that I don't have to worry about it until next year.
12. Congratulations! You are now ready to leave the country! You do have your ticket to the US, don't you?

## Parting Thoughts

As I said above, the process was relatively painless. I could have made it go faster if I had all my docs ready before I went there, but generally, I'm relieved that it wasn't as bad as I expected. As for you, be sure to check with POEA in case the fees and requirements have changed. You can try [their website](http://www.poea.gov.ph) although I personally didn't find it very helpful. Good luck!
