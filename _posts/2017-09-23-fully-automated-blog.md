I finally got around to fully automating my blog generation including
the resume rendering part (both HTML and PDF formats). [This is the change](https://github.com/relaxdiego/relaxdiego.github.com/commit/6b5b222ab3fa7cd6288111abfe99b79c13fbd665)
that made that happen. 

So now my workflow just involves starting Foreman in one terminal
session while, in a separate session, I work inside Vim to write another
blog post or update my resume.

Automation rocks.
