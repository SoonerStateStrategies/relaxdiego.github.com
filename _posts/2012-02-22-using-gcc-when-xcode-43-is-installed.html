title: Using GCC when Xcode 4.2 or 4.3 is installed

<p>I was having problems compiling gems from the terminal in my Mac last week. After further investigation and some Googling, I found out that it was because Xcode 4.3 now uses the LLVM-based gcc and not all native gems support it. I then installed the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action" target="_blank">Command Line Tools for Xcode</a>&nbsp;hoping that would solve the problem. Unfortunately, it didn't. At least not completely.</p>

<p>After some more digging around, I came to realize that <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>, which is what gets used by default, is actually symlinked to <code>/usr/bin/llvm-gcc-4.2</code>. I tried setting <code>CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2</code> whenever I installed gems, but somehow that gets lost along the way. Some suggested that I downgrade to Xcode 4.1 or even uninstall Xcode altogether. However, in my case, I use Xcode every now and then so that was not an option.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I came across <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1165361/setting-gcc-4-2-as-the-default-compiler-on-mac-os-x-leopard" target="_blank">a suggestion in StackOverflow</a>&nbsp;which said that I create symlinks to the classic gcc and make sure it's accessed first when I'm in the terminal. Here's how I did it:<br /><br />First, I created a hidden folder in my home directory:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ mkdir .bin
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next, I created symlinks in <code>~/.bin</code>:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ cd .bin
~/.bin $ ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.2 cc
~/.bin $ ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.2 gcc
~/.bin $ ln -s /usr/bin/c++-4.2 c++
~/.bin $ ln -s /usr/bin/g++-4.2 g++
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Note that in order for those to work, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action" target="_blank">Command Line Tools for Xcode</a> should be installed. You can do that via direct download or through Xcode's Downloads preference pane.</p>

<p>Next, I edited <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and appended the following:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
export PATH=~/.bin:$PATH
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The above ensures that my symlinks are used and not <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>. I then reloaded <code>.bash_profile</code>:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ source .bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}

<p>After this, all native gems compiled successfully.</p>
