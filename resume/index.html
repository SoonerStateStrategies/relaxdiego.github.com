<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Designed, Built, and Maintained Test Harnesses</strong> - I have been building test harnesses and test harness frameworks for the past seven years. Some of them were built with Ruby while others were built with Python. The types of applications I&#8217;ve built test harnesses for include web applications, CLI utilities, and network device software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Built a Proof-of-Concept Automated Testing Language</strong> - I combined the things I liked about Cucumber and the Robot Framework into my own automated testing language. This language reads like English (or any human language) and can be used to test itself. I consider this a hobby project that I use to learn about language design. The project is on <a href="https://github.com/ManaManaFramework/manamana">Github</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Built and Open Sourced API Libraries</strong> - I have extensive experience writing client libraries for REST and other HTTP-related APIs. One of them is <a href="http://aviator.github.io/www/">Aviator</a>, a Ruby library originally built for the OpenStack API but can be expanded to support other cloud providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Created an Agile Plugin for Redmine</strong> - Redmine is an open software configuration management application. I built an agile plugin for it called Redmine Backlogs. These days, it is being maintained by a self-managing community at <a href="http://www.redminebacklogs.net" class="bare">http://www.redminebacklogs.net</a> and has also be forked by other projects such as <a href="https://www.openproject.org/features/agile-scrum/">OpenProject</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Python</strong> - I&#8217;ve used Python to write properietary application and test harness frameworks in the cloud computing and software defined networking space. I also have extensive experience writing CLI utilities with Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong> - I am experienced with Rails, Sinatra, and many other Ruby libraries relating to web development and automated testing. I have written <a href="http://aviator.github.io/www/">a Ruby client library for OpenStack</a>. I&#8217;m also very proficient with Ruby metaprogramming and use it extensively to write easy-to-use and expressive internal domain-specific languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agile Application Development</strong> - I practice fast prototyping and take advantage of the fast feedback provided by automated testing to get to the most appropriate solution faster. I also temper this with object-oriented design principles and a focus on testability and maintainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated Testing</strong> - I&#8217;ve written external test harnesses in Ruby and Python. I&#8217;ve also created my own proof-of-concept BDD framework inspired by Cucumber and the Robot Framework. <a href="https://github.com/ManaManaFramework/manamana">Source in Github</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Open vSwitch Lab</strong> - A Vagrant project that provisions two machines that talk over a simulated Internet. The lab is a companion project for the series of articles I wrote about <a href="http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/ovs-lab.html">VXLAN</a>, <a href="http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/ovsdb.html">OVSDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/hardware_vtep.html">the hardware VTEP schema</a>. <a href="https://github.com/relaxdiego/ovs-lab">Source in Github</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aviator</strong> - A lightweight Ruby client library for cloud REST APIs. I initially built this for the OpenStack API. My focus was to build a library that reflected, rather than obscured the underlying API. <a href="http://aviator.github.io/www/">Homepage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mana Mana</strong> - A proof-of-concept business natural language testing framework that was inspired by Cucumber and the Robot framework. This was borne of my never-ending search for better ways to write maintainable automated tests. <a href="https://github.com/ManaManaFramework/manamana">Source in Github</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proprietary OpenStack Dashboard</strong> - A multi-tenant dashboard for OpenStack built on Ruby/Rails that had its own billing module which was built on top of OpenStack Ceilometer.</p>
